9:Tf2e,<p>The first thing anyone tells you about prioritising is that you need to have a framework. There's a bunch to choose from. RICE, ICE, Kano, MoSCoW. If you work in a startup, you don't have time to find explanations of all of these, let alone learn them properly.</p>
<p>Deciding which features to add to a product is hard. There's always competing priorities. Should you do the thing that is quick and will add a few monthly active users or the thing that is hard that will add more?</p>
<p>Let me tell you a story of a pizza shop. To follow along, open <a href="https://www.mismit.com/pizza-example">https://www.mismit.com/pizza-example</a> and see it unfold.</p>
<p>Happy Hipster Pizza was planning their opening. They'd got a shop, fitted it out and done some customer research. They had big plans for a full menu but realised they needed to streamline operations in the first year, so they only had prep space for one type of pizza. They'd narrowed it down to just five flavours: Pepperoni, Hawaiian, BBQ Chicken, Farmhouse and the classic Margherita.</p>
<p>They knew that Pepperoni was the most desierable topping in their target audience but also wanted to factor in the cost of the ingredients and the time to prepare. Knowing they wanted to boostrap the business, they wanted to be profitable from day one.</p>
<p>To decide on a priority for the flavours, they needed to combine the different factors into the ranking. They'd read about <a href="https://www.statology.org/excel-weighted-ranking/">weighted ranking</a> but how much more important was customer desirability than cost of ingredients? Was it 2x or 2.2x?</p>
<p>Using Mismit, they did a pairwise comparison of the different factors.</p>
<p>They decided they valued customer demand over cost of ingredients thinking that, if the flavour was popular enough, people would pay. They also valued time to prepare over cost of ingredients thinking that, if they could turnover more pizzas, they'd make more profit. Finally they valued customer demand over time to prepare thinking that, if people wanted the pizza enough, they'd wait for it to be ready.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/blog/prioritising-product-features/step3.png" alt="Step 3 of the pairwise comparison, showing how they value each ranking dimension as described in the previous paragrpah."></p>
<p>Then they went through each flavour and decided how closely each one aligned with the factors. Pepperoni ingredients weren't expensive but weren't cheap; it has high customer demand and it was relatively quick to prepare. Hawaiian had a slightly higher cost of ingredients, pretty low customer demand and took a long time to prepare. Margherita ingredients are cheap, had pretty good customer demand and was very quick to prepare. BBQ Chicken had similar cost of ingredients to the other meat toppings, decent customer demand but took quite a while to prepare. Farmhouse ingredients were in the middle, customer demand was good and time to prepare was fairly quick.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/blog/prioritising-product-features/step4.png" alt="Step 4 of the pairwise comparison, showing how each flavour ranked against each dimension."></p>
<p>The results surprised them. Despite the higher cost of ingredients and longer time to prepare, Pepperoni came out on top!</p>
<pre><code>1. Pepperoni (1.50)
2. Margherita (1.42)
3. Farmhouse (0.83)
4. BBQ Chicken (0.17)
5. Hawaiian (-1.00)
</code></pre>
<p>Using a weighted ranking with pairwise comparison, they were able to take a subjective conversation and make it objective.
They loved data-driven decisions and this method was able to combine data without introducing the subjectivity of saying "we prefer this factor by a specific weight more than another".</p>
<p>You'll be glad to know Happy Hipster Pizza opened to great fanfare and it wasn't long before they were able to add more flavours to the menu.</p>
